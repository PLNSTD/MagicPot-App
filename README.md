This sample showcases the behavior of a bottom navigation view following the Principles of Navigation.

    Fixed start destination
    Navigation state should be represented via a stack of destinations
    The Up button never exits your app
    Up and Back are identical within your app's task
    Deep linking and navigating to a destination should yield the same stack

Check out the UI tests to learn about specific scenarios.
